==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HexagonMC/BungeeCord.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HexagonMC/BungeeCord)

This is a fork of md_5's BungeeCord  
https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/1-8-1-9-bungeecord.392/

This version reimplements Minecraft 1.7.10 and basic 1.7.10 Forge support.

Since release 134+, SpongePls is no longer needed when using Sponge-servers within your network!

IMPORTANT: We WON'T fix any 1.7 bugs. 
This fork is designed for keeping your old servers in your network, until your modspacks are available for 1.10.2/1.11.2 or higher.
Most of them are, so get rid of 1.7 fast and move to 1.10.2/1.11.2 modpacks asap.
