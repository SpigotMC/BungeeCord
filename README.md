BungeeCord
==========
The most reliable Minecraft server portal suite.
------------------------------------------------
BungeeCord is a piece of Java software which allows a user to link multiple Minecraft servers together, allowing players to teleport between them and access advanced features. This makes it perfect for servers looking to expand their player base and spread across multiple gameplay styles.

History
-------
For a long time developers have tried to create these mythical 'cloud' systems as outlined above. Until now, none of them have succeeded in making a fully open source and reliable 'cloud'. You may have already noticed my quoting of the word 'cloud', and this is one of the last times you will see it in this document. BungeeCord is **NOT** a 'cloud'. The actual meaning of the aforementioned word is quoted below:

>The use of computing resources (hardware and software) that are delivered as a service over a network (typically the Internet).

BungeeCord does not do this and therefore is not a 'cloud'. Please do not refer to it as one, since the owners and operators of real clouds will get very angry, and you will be seen as ignorant and stupid. Instead I encourage you to use the term 'Server Port Suite' or something to that effect.
